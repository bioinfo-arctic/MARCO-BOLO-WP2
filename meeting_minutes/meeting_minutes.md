**Kim** 
> Include Pascal Hablützel (pascal.hablutzel@vliz.be) in the email list. (Won't be in the Paris Meeting) 
> Ring test in Genes projects... to compare pipelines – Sangamberk   

**Saara**
> Sarah asking about the samples she receive today if they belong to "MAPS" 
Sequencing platform NovaSeq 6000 – PCR free library prep. 
She would like to be able to compare different pipelines 
Use of a Standard dataset (Mock Community) 
Make a comparison website to show how different pipelines influence the results 
R pacman pipeline – Example of different tools to perform the tasks

**Kim**
> What should be our angle during the meeting in Paris. Should we meet and discuss deliverables? 
Need for reorganization after the leaving of Owen and Lucie  

**Pascal**
> Start on pipeline comparison  

**Kim**
> Agreed, focus on what should be on the initial page.  
What is the data format that should be distributed?  
What sort of data? OTU table, Graphs ... 

**Saara**
> Should we give them a workflow or just pipeline recommendations? 

**Pascal**
> If we offer a species list, it will be straight forward. 
Taxonomic assignment is tricky, so should we give guidelines to include further information in the taxonomical lists. Further information as if the species has ever been seen there or if it makes sense to see these species there 

**Kim**
> The database we use is based on the species we always have here. We could upload our sequences to the database and track them, irrespective of the taxonomic annotation.  

**Saara**
> We should make an action plan based on deliverables   

**Pascal**
> Problems fulfilling the task of inferring functions, as said in task 2.3 

**Daniel**
> Attribution of ecological roles instead of functions... 

**Kim**
>Focus on the higher and general deliverables 
We will make slides focusing on those for the next meeting (07.03) 
Challenges to surpass after the main authors of the WP are not the leaders anymore.  

>How are we going to approach the work to be done? 
Suggestion to keep regular meetings (all agree on monthly basis meetings) 
Helpful to keep momentum and present results.  
Mondays at 14:00 (agreed by all) 

Next meeting to present a more concrete plan of action with the focus on the big picture.
